# BUS_393_Project
Database project for BUS 393

## Project Description
We have chosen to investigate the OCOB Student Services, specifically the OCOB Alumni Mentoring Program. This program focuses on supporting Orfalea College of Business students by pairing them with an Alumni in order to bolster their career readiness, cultivate professional relationships, explore industries, and empower students to be competitive job candidates. The Alumni who participate in the program come from a wide array of fields and organizations, and have varying years of experience, from 1 to 10+ years. Students fill out their preferences for Alumni coaches and commit to monthly sessions, in person or remotely. Students and Alumni both are taken through an onboarding process, providing imperative feedback to the organizaiton, used to refine and improve the service for all.
